# slqv-arduino-enigma
My first ever real Arduino program is a fully functional enigma machine.

Designed for use on "borrowed" school materials:  
Yourduino red board, 20x4 yourduino i2c LCD display  
3 pushbuttons: Left pin 3, middle pin 4, right pin 5  
I may try to either expand this into a physical emulator or make it into a portable format
