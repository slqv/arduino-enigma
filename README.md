# slqv-arduino-enigma
Fully functional 3-button Arduino enigma machine  
This was my first Arduino project and first real program on any platform, go easy on me.  

Designed for use on "borrowed" school materials:  
Yourduino red board, 20x4 yourduino i2c LCD display  
3 pushbuttons: Left pin 3, middle pin 4, right pin 5  
I may try to either expand this into a physical emulator or make it into a portable format
